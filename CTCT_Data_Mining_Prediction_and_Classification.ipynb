        "\n",
        "### Method Differences\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. **analyze_datasets_for_target_column**\n",
        "- **Purpose**: A general method designed for predicting any target column, applicable for both classification and regression tasks depending on the target column type.\n",
        "- **Unique Aspects**: Versatile and adaptable to different types of target columns (e.g., `Total_AP`, `Total_PP`, `FinalGrade`). It supports different feature selection methods, imputation strategies, and can handle both regression and classification tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **analyze_final_grade_with_advanced_ensembles**\n",
        "- **Purpose**: Focused on predicting the `FinalGrade` target column using advanced ensemble techniques, specifically optimized for regression tasks.\n",
        "- **Unique Aspects**: Utilizes advanced models like XGBoost, LightGBM, and Stacking to improve prediction accuracy. The method is specifically tailored for enhancing the predictive performance for the `FinalGrade` column.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **analyze_final_grade_with_imputation_strategies**\n",
        "- **Purpose**: Extends the analysis of `FinalGrade` by testing various imputation strategies to determine the most effective approach for missing data, in conjunction with advanced ensemble models.\n",
        "- **Unique Aspects**: Iteratively applies different imputation strategies (e.g., `mean`, `median`, `zero`, `knn`, `most_frequent`, `constant`) and evaluates ensemble models, selecting the best combination overall for predicting `FinalGrade`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### When to Use Each Method\n",
        "\n",
        "- **General Prediction**: Use `analyze_datasets_for_target_column` when you need a flexible tool to predict any column, with support for both regression and classification. This method is versatile and can be adapted to various target columns and tasks.\n",
        "- **Optimized Predictions for FinalGrade**: Utilize `analyze_final_grade_with_advanced_ensembles` if you want to leverage advanced ensemble techniques specifically for predicting `FinalGrade` and achieve better predictive performance in regression tasks.\n",
        "- **Best Imputation Strategy for FinalGrade**: Apply `analyze_final_grade_with_imputation_strategies` when you need to determine the most effective imputation strategy in addition to optimizing model performance for predicting `FinalGrade`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Common Parameters\n",
        "\n",
        "These methods share a set of common parameters that allow for flexible and customizable analysis of datasets. Below are the shared parameters that you will find in each method:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Parameters:**\n",
        "- `datasets_dict`: A dictionary containing the datasets to be analyzed.\n",
        "- `target_column`: The column you want to predict (e.g., 'Total_AP', 'Passed', 'FinalGrade').\n",
        "- `exclusion_type`: Specifies the dataset filtering criteria (e.g., 'more_restricted', 'restricted', 'less_restricted').\n",
        "- `feature_set_name`: The name of the feature selection method to be used (e.g., 'MI' for Mutual Information). If `None`, no feature selection is applied.\n",
        "- `imputation_strategy`: Specifies how to handle missing data (e.g., 'mean', 'median', 'zero', 'knn', 'most_frequent', 'constant').\n",
        "- `apply_pca`: A boolean indicating whether to apply PCA for dimensionality reduction.\n",
        "- `apply_scaling`: A boolean indicating whether to scale the features.\n",
        "- `columns_to_scale`: Specific columns to scale. If `None`, all columns except the target column are scaled.\n",
        "- `group_col`: The column by which to group data before applying scaling (optional).\n",
        "- `cv`: Number of cross-validation folds (default is 5).\n",
