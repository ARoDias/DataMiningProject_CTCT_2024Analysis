        "## Overview\n",
        "This notebook is designed to process and analyze educational data related to various activities and their characteristics over multiple years. It utilizes Python for data manipulation, including creating pivot tables, generating summary statistics, and visualizing data through heatmaps. The code is organized into functions to enhance modularity and readability.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Function Descriptions\n",
        "\n",
        "#### `process_activities(dataset_params)`\n",
        "This function processes activity data to create detailed and pivot tables:\n",
        "- **Input:** A dictionary where each key represents a year and its value contains parameters, including an activity dictionary.\n",
        "- **Process:** Iterates through each year, processes activities based on their characteristics (e.g., evaluation type, student grouping), and compiles them into a DataFrame.\n",
        "- **Output:** Returns two DataFrames; one detailed (`activities_df`) and one summarized as a pivot table (`activities_pivot`).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### `process_activities2(dataset_params)`\n",
        "Similar to `process_activities`, but slightly varies in handling and summarization:\n",
        "- **Output:** Provides a summarized DataFrame grouped by evaluation type and year, showing activity counts and lists (`summary_df2`).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Heatmap Visualization\n",
        "Generates a heatmap from the pivot table to visually represent activity data across different characteristics and years.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### `load_and_process_data(year, params)`\n",
        "Loads and processes annual datasets based on provided parameters:\n",
        "- **Process:** Includes reading files, filtering columns, handling missing values, and renaming columns for consistency.\n",
        "- **Output:** Returns two datasets, one for students who passed and another for those who failed based on the grading criteria.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Combination and Cleaning\n",
        "- **Combine Datasets:** Combines passed and failed datasets for each year.\n",
        "- **Clean Datasets:** Removes rows and columns that are completely empty across the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Usage of Basic and Advanced List Generation Functions\n",
        "\n",
        "#### `generate_basic_lists(dataset)`\n",
        "Generates various lists categorizing the columns of a dataset, such as categorical columns, grade-related columns, and others based on their presence in the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### `generate_weekly_and_participation_lists(dataset, listAsyncColumns)`\n",
        "Creates lists for columns related to weekly data and participation points, facilitating detailed temporal analysis.\n",

        "Categorizes activities into multiple lists based on their types and characteristics, aiding in focused analyses of activity data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Comprehensive Data Processing and Reporting\n",
        "\n",
        "#### `process_combined_datasets(cleaned_datasets, dataset_params)`\n",
        "Integrates all list generation and data processing functions to create a structured summary of all lists and data characteristics for each year, aiding in comprehensive data analysis and decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Presentation of Processed Data\n",
        "- **Initial Display:** Shows the head of combined datasets for initial verification.\n",
        "- **Student Count Reporting:** Reports the count of students participating in asynchronous and synchronous classes.\n",
        "- **Numeric Type Setting and New Column Creation:** Converts relevant columns to numeric types and calculates totals for different activity and participation points.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Additional Utilities\n",
        "- Functions to create weekly and total datasets for deeper analysis.\n",
        "- Functions to handle missing values and drop specific columns as needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "This structured approach ensures that the educational data is thoroughly processed, analyzed, and ready for use in decision-making regarding educational strategies and interventions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Handling Outliers\n",
        "The following functions manage and correct outliers in the dataset based on defined thresholds, although the dataset adjustments are not used in further analysis as zero grades are meaningful in this context.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### `handle_outliers(data_dict)`\n",
        "- **Description:** Adjusts outliers by capping them at the 1st and 99th percentiles for specific columns.\n",
        "- **Input:** Dictionary of DataFrames keyed by year.\n",
        "- **Process:** Calculates the interquartile range (IQR) for specified columns and replaces extreme outliers with percentile caps.\n",
        "- **Output:** Returns the corrected datasets and a dictionary detailing the changes made to each column.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Outlier Detection and Reporting\n",

        "  - **Description:** Compares the original and corrected datasets to identify and document changes.\n",
        "- **Implementation:** Iterates through each year and column, documenting any modifications due to outlier adjustments.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Printing Identified Outliers\n",
        "- **Operation:** Iterates through each year's dataset to print details about high and low outliers in the 'Total_AP' column based on the computed thresholds.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Verification and Correction\n",
        "Ensures the dataset's structure and entries are aligned with expected activity characterizations.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### `verify_and_correct_activities(dataset_complete, all_lists)`\n",
        "- **Description:** Checks if the datasets include all expected activity types and identifies any uncharacterized or mislabeled activities.\n",
        "- **Process:** Utilizes lists from `all_lists` to verify each activity's presence and characteristics against the dataset columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Column Renaming and Updates\n",
        "Updates column names for consistency across datasets based on year-specific rules.\n",
        "\n",
